We are working on this section. Please check at some other time. We have used Central Limit Theorem and worked witha population of 10000 and worked with 1000 samples of sample size 50.

## Technologies-used

Python programming language, pandas and matplotlib package.

## Dataset

The data set is synthetically generated and used for demonstrating the concept only. The program can be easily modified to show results with real readings taken from the patients.

## Program-codes
